FAMOptimizer
Frequency-Adaptive Momentum optimizer with parameter-specific handlers. + FAMScheduler. Work in progress.
This optimizer is specifically for ASR type models but works well without the FAM which can be controlled (turned on) by step count. fam_start_step=100
An experimental approach specifically designed for speech recognition tasks, FAM adapts momentum based on the frequency characteristics of gradient updates.
