# FAMOptimizer
Frequency-Adaptive Momentum optimizer with parameter-specific handlers. + FAMScheduler. Work in progress.

This optimizer is specifically for ASR type models but works well without the FAM which can be controlled (turned on) by step count. fam_start_step=100

An experimental approach specifically designed for speech recognition tasks, FAM adapts momentum based on the frequency characteristics of gradient updates.

### Frequency-Adaptive Momentum (FAM)

#### Core Concept

- Speech signals possess an inherent frequency structure, with different parts of the model responding to various frequency bands. This frequency structure remains preserved, albeit transformed, when converted to log-mel spectrograms, with model parameters adapting to capture this structure.
- The Chain of Frequency Information: Original Audio → Log-Mel Spectrogram → Encoder Parameters → Gradient Updates.
- Empirical observations reveal that transformer-based speech models develop:
  - Lower encoder layers with filters responsive to specific frequency bands in the mel spectrogram.
  - Attention heads tracking particular acoustic patterns over time.
  - A hierarchical representation from acoustic features to phonetic units to words.
- FAM aims to integrate a momentum scheme that adapts based on the "frequency signature" of gradient updates.

#### Why This Optimizer Makes Sense

FAM acknowledges the frequency structure within the optimization process itself, recognizing that:
- **Gradient Frequencies Matter:** The Fourier transform of gradient updates reveals patterns linked to the model's current learning phase.
- **Different Parameters Process Different Bands:** Similar to how our ears have frequency-specific receptors, different parts of the model specialize in various acoustic frequencies.
- **Temporal Structure in Learning:** Speech learning progresses through stages - from basic acoustics to phonetic patterns to linguistic structures.

By applying distinct momentum factors to different frequency bands in parameter space, FAM provides the optimizer with domain-specific audio information that it otherwise wouldn't have.

# FAMOptimizer

**FAMOptimizer** (Frequency-Adaptive Momentum Optimizer) is a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm, **specifically designed for models that process sound, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.** Its frequency-adaptive approach makes it uniquely suited for handling the challenges prevalent in audio-based models, where parameter updates often vary across frequency domains.

This optimizer is particularly effective in training neural networks for tasks involving sound and speech, leveraging frequency-domain insights to dynamically adjust momentum and learning rates. FAMOptimizer enables robust, efficient, and stable training for niche audio-related applications.

## Quick Start

Here’s a quick example to get started with FAMOptimizer in an ASR or sound-related model:

```python
import torch
from FAMOptimizer import FAMOptimizer

# Define your ASR or sound-processing model
model = MyASRModel()  # Replace with your model

# Define your loss function
criterion = torch.nn.CTCLoss()  # Example: CTC loss for ASR models

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = FAMOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, beta=0.9)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for audio_inputs, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(audio_inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## How It Works

FAMOptimizer introduces an innovative approach to optimization by adapting momentum and learning rates based on the frequency of parameter updates. This is especially beneficial for sound-related tasks, where frequency-domain characteristics play a critical role:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: Tracks parameter update patterns to identify high- and low-frequency components.
2. **Dynamic Momentum Adjustment**: Modulates momentum values to stabilize updates for high-frequency components while accelerating low-frequency ones, aligning perfectly with the needs of audio models.
3. **Parameter-Specific Control**: Enables unique optimization strategies for different parameter groups, allowing for precise fine-tuning in complex ASR architectures.

## Recommended Use Cases

FAMOptimizer excels in scenarios involving sound and speech processing, including:

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Handles the unique frequency characteristics of speech signals, improving convergence and accuracy.
- **Audio Classification**: Enhances performance on tasks such as music genre classification or sound event detection.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Stabilizes and accelerates training for models like Tacotron or WaveNet.
- **General Sound Processing**: Ideal for reinforcement learning models or neural networks operating on audio signals.

## Hyperparameters

FAMOptimizer provides several hyperparameters for customization:

- `lr` (float): Base learning rate. Default: `0.001`
- `beta` (float): Frequency-adaptive momentum factor. Default: `0.9`
- `weight_decay` (float): Weight decay (L2 penalty). Default: `0.0`
- `eps` (float): Small value to prevent division by zero. Default: `1e-8`

These hyperparameters can be adjusted to suit the specific requirements of your ASR or sound-processing model.

## Advanced Configuration

FAMOptimizer supports advanced configurations for parameter grouping and custom update rules. For example, you can define parameter-specific learning rates and momentum as follows:

```python
optimizer = FAMOptimizer([
    {'params': model.encoder.parameters(), 'lr': 0.01, 'beta': 0.8},  # Encoder for ASR model
    {'params': model.decoder.parameters(), 'lr': 0.001, 'beta': 0.9}  # Decoder for ASR model
])
```

## Benchmarks

FAMOptimizer has been benchmarked against popular optimizers like Adam, SGD, and RMSProp in sound-related tasks. Below are highlights from ASR and audio-processing benchmarks:

- **ASR on LibriSpeech Dataset**: Achieved faster convergence and higher word error rate (WER) improvements compared to Adam and SGD optimizers.
- **Audio Event Detection**: Demonstrated superior stability and performance on datasets like UrbanSound8K.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Outperformed standard optimizers in training Tacotron-based TTS systems, reducing training time significantly.
